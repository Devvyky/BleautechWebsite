```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/{YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME}/bleautech.git

```

If you are working on frontend Pull the code to Your project directory and set it up by running the following command
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout frontend
```
If you are working on the laravel Pull the code to Your project directory and set it up by running the following command
```bash

This will ensure that you have all 3 branches

Then when pushing if you are on the frontend branch you push directly to the frontend after editing
